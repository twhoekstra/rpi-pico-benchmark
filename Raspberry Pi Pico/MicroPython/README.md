Note: The `.mpy` files have been compiled using the following settings in `mpy-cross`: 
```
mpy version: 5
mpy flags: -march=armv7m
```

The precompiled bytecode in these files is intended for use on the Raspberry Pi Pico. It is most likely to not work for other boards without redoing the cross-compiling step. The code for this has been provided in the similarly named `.py` files.
